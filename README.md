# Circa-Beta
# This app is currently in the Beta stage and is open source. Feel free to download and contribute back with revised code as needed. 
# Circuit solving tool in which a database of resistors and capacitors are loaded onto the phone. The user can then find frequencies based upon what physical components they have in front of them. 
# The motivation behind this project was that i am currently studying electronic and computer systems engineering and sometimes stock runs out in the labs. Continuous use of parallel resistor  and passive filter calculators are tedious if you don't have the right components in front of you. Definitely has further potential
# However a web based app would probablly be preferred in the future. 
# Has minor bugs but doesn't really affect the overall functionality of the product.
# Code has not been cleaned up and is still in the raw state
