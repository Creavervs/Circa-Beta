# Circa-Beta
# This app is currently in the Beta stage and is open source. Feel free to download and contribute back with revised code as needed. 
# Circuit solving tool in which a database of resistors and capacitors are loaded onto the phone. The user can then find frequencies based
# upon what physical components they have in front of them. 
# The motivation behind this project was that i am currently studying electrical engineering and sometimes stock runs out in the labs. 
# This does the hard work for you in which cut off frequencies can be calculated which should ultimately save time. Constantly use parallel
# resistor calculator and passive filter calculator on a daily basis so im pretty happy with the end product. Definitely has further potential
# however a web based app would probablly be preferred in the future. 
# Has minor bugs but doesn not really affect the overall functionality of the product.
# Code has not been cleaned up and is still in the raw state
