# Circa-Beta
# This app is currently in the Beta stage and is open source. Feel free to download and contribute back with revised code as needed. 
# Circuit solving tool in which a database of resistors and capacitors are loaded onto the phone. The user can then find frequencies based upon what physical components they have in front of them. 
# The motivation behind this project was that i was finding is that online filter tools were designed to run of all value of resistors/capacitros and stock runs out in the labs. Continuous use of parallel resistor  and passive filter calculators are tedious if you don't have the right components in front of you. 
# However a web based app would probablly be preferred in the future. 
# Has minor bugs but doesn't really affect the overall functionality of the product. 
# Code has not been cleaned up and is still in the raw state
