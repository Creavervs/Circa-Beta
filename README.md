# Circa-Beta ( 6 weeks )
# This app is currently in the Beta stage and is open source. Feel free to download and contribute back with revised code as needed. 
# Circuit solving tool in which a database of resistors and capacitors are loaded onto the phone. The user can then find frequencies based upon what physical components they have in front of them. 
# The motivation behind this project was that i was finding is that online filter tools were designed to run of all value of resistors/capacitors and stock runs out in the labs. Continuous use of parallel resistor  and passive filter calculators are tedious if you don't have the right components in front of you. 
# However a web based app would probablly be preferred in the future. 
# Has minor bugs but doesn't really affect the overall functionality of the product. 
# App suffered from problems with scalability as was only ever intended to do filter calculations. As development continued graphical representation of components, colour and margins of error were introduced to more fairly represent the physical constraints of electronics. With increased complexity and lack of planning the project was stopped and distributed in a "As is, where is" condition to students who were interested.
